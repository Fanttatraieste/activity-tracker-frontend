Make sure you have latest Node and npm version. To run the app, first you need to run the command npm i (or npm install) and then to run the angular app, run the command ng serve

## Development server

If you have corse errors when accessing the backend application, make sure you deal with them in the controllers in the backend. In java I think there is an annotation specific to allow a specific client (for us, angular will be running on localhost:4200)

## Code scaffolding

Make sure when writing code to apply the eslint guides, and also make sure to apply the format on save settings on vscode, such that vscode will format your code based on the prettier configs
